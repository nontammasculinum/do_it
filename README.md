# do_it
a game engine using dopixels, dophysics, doinput, and doppm

you can use build (you may have to compile build.c if you are not on linux) like so to build your files with all the dependencies required
```
./build <compiler> <flags>
```
i.e if i am compiling a main.c into main with gcc
```
./build "gcc" "main.c -o main"
```
all else you need to do to get started it include "do\_it.h" :)
